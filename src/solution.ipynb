    "> ### Problem: Adversarial Noise (from the author's description)\n",
    ">The task involves developing a program that manipulates images by adding adversarial noise. This noise is designed to trick an image classification model into misclassifying the altered image as a specified target class, regardless of the original content.\n",
    "> - You may select any pre-trained image classification model for this task. A model from the torchvision library is recommended, but not mandatory.\n",
    "> - The core challenge is to effectively introduce noise into the image in such a way that the model misclassifies it as the desired target class, without making the noise perceptible to a casual human viewer.\n",

    "The goal of the challenge is to develop a program that adds adversarial noise to images with the aim of tricking an image classification model without being detected by a human. \n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, consider that $\\mathcal{D} = \\{ (x_i, y_i) \\}_{i=1}^N$ is a dataset of images and their corresponding labels. Let also $f_{\\theta}: \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathcal{Y}$ be a pre-trained image classification model with estimated parameters $\\theta$, where $\\mathcal{X}$ is the space of images and $\\mathcal{Y}$ is the space of labels that achieves $a%$ accuracy a dataset. The goal is to find an adversarial noise $\\epsilon$ such that the model misclassifies the image $x_i$:\n",

    "3. **Adversarial Noise**: A perturbation that can be added to the images\n",

    "This will guide the development of the solution thorough this notebook.\n",

    "The dataset used in this challenge is the [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images."
